# CPP Library Symbol Management

Repository containing examples of what the implications are of exposing/hiding *symbols*, the order of linking *libraries*/*object-files*, etc.

### Term 
- Symbol: a unique identifier used to represent variables, functions, or other entities in code. Symbols are often stored in a symbol table, which ensures their uniqueness and helps the compiler or interpreter manage them efficiently
- Object file: Intermediate file generated by the compiler from source code; Contains machine code, symbols, and metadata; Linked together with other object files to create an executable or a library; Object files are typically specific to a single build process; 
- Library: Collection of precompiled object files that provide reusable code; Contains compiled code, symbols;
